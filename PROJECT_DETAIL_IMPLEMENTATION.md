# Project Detail Implementation

## Overview

The ProjectDetailView component has been updated to follow the same structure and patterns as the HackathonDetail component. It now fetches project data dynamically from the backend API and presents it in a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Data Loading**: Projects are loaded from the backend API based on URL parameters
2. **Image Gallery**: Support for multiple project images with carousel navigation
3. **Responsive Design**: Layouts adapt to different screen sizes
4. **Error Handling**: Proper loading states, error messages, and not-found states
5. **Data Parsing**: Automatic handling of different data formats (JSON strings, arrays)
6. **Organized Content**: Information is categorized into logical sections (features, technologies, team)

## API Integration

The component uses the newly created project API endpoints:

- `getProjectById`: Fetches a specific project by ID
- `getAllProjects`: Gets a list of all projects
- `searchProjects`: Searches projects by query or category

## Component Structure

1. **Header Section**: Title, category, and back navigation
2. **Image Gallery**: Main project image with thumbnails for multiple images
3. **Project Info**: Description, technologies, links
4. **Details Section**: Features, challenges, team members
5. **Stats Section**: Duration, team size, technology count

## CSS Styling

A dedicated CSS file provides consistent styling that matches the overall design language of the portfolio site.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add related projects section
2. Support for project video demos
3. Timeline visualization for project development phases
